  |   When a young traveling chef named Kawase arrives in the frontier      |
  |   town of Kingness, she finds it to be a perfect real-life replica of   |
  |   a town that she used to dream of as a child. Intrigued, she takes a   |
  |   job as a delivery person and occasional chef for a local              |
  |   restaurant. Through exploration and conversations with the locals,    |
  |   Kawase gradually learns the history of the town, the mysterious       |
  |   castle that floats above it, the dangerous cavern that lurks below    |
  |   it and the unspeakable demons who have terrorized its residents.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In Umihara Kawase Fresh!, Kawase carries a fishing lure with          |
  |   "rubber-band action". The lure can be used as a grappling hook to     |
  |   swing from platforms, as a winch to raise or lower herself while      |
  |   suspended, like a bungee cord to slingshot herself in any direction   |
  |   and as a weapon to stun or defeat enemies. The lure can also          |
  |   capture enemies and items in the environment, pulling them in to be   |
  |   stored in the infinite space of Kawase's seemingly magical            |
  |   backpack.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |

  |                                                                         |

  |     recipes and additional quests to undertake                          |
  |                                                                         |
